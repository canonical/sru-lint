================

This module provides a function to validate whether a given patch file (passed
as a string) contains a header that complies with the Debian DEP-3 Patch
Tagging Guidelines.

DEP-3 (Debian Enhancement Proposal 3) defines a minimal set of meta-data
fields that should be embedded at the top of any patch distributed within a
Debian source package.  These fields are stored in one or more RFC-2822 style
headers and allow tooling and humans to understand the purpose and origin
of a patch.  According to the specification:

* A header starts on the first non-empty line of the patch and ends on the
  first empty line.  A second header, called the *pseudo-header*, may appear
  after a blank line.  Any parsing must stop when a line containing exactly
  three dashes (``---``) is encountered.
* Each field consists of a name followed by a colon and its value.  Continuation
  lines begin with a single space (or ``#  `` when the header is commented
  out) and are folded into the value of the previous field.  Unknown lines
  outside of field definitions are treated as free-form text and appended to
  the description.
* At least one of ``Description`` or ``Subject`` must be present, and the
  short description (the text after the colon on the first line) must be
  non-empty.
* An ``Origin`` field is required unless an ``Author`` (or its alias ``From``)
  is provided.  ``Subject`` is considered an alias
  for ``Description``, and ``From`` is an alias for ``Author``.
* Additional optional fields, such as ``Bug``, ``Forwarded``, ``Last-Update``
  and ``Applied-Upstream``, are ignored for the purposes of compliance
  checking.  However, if present, this implementation performs basic
  validation of ``Last-Update`` (must follow the ISO ``YYYY-MM-DD`` date
  format) and ``Forwarded`` (must be either ``no``, ``not-needed`` or a
  plausible URL as per the guidelines).

The :func:`check_dep3_compliance` function returns a tuple consisting of a
boolean indicating compliance and a list of strings describing any detected
issues.  A patch is considered compliant if it includes a non-empty
``Description`` or ``Subject`` and either an ``Origin`` or an ``Author``/
``From`` field.  Additional validity checks are performed on optional
fields when they are present.
